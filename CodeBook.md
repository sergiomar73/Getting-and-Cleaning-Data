- There were 561 variables in the original data sets
- The final data set contains **88 variables**
- A 86-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
  - Included all variables with the text 'mean', because the ausence of an exact criteria to exclude any. There are 53 variables:
	  - containing 'mean()': 33 variables
	  - containing 'meanFreq()': 13 variables
	  - angle() variables:  7 variables
  - Included all variables with the text 'std' (33 variables). 
- The **Subject Id** was obtained by joining with the *subject\_train.txt* and *subject\_test.txt* file 
- The **Activity Id** was transformed into its **Activity Description** by joining with the *activity_labels.txt* file
- The remaining **86 variables** were obtained by the aggregation of the merged data set by:
 - Subject Id
 - Activity  
- And obtaining the average of each variable
- The data of the 86 variables has been **normalised** in the original data source and bounded within [-1,1]

**You can read the original CodeBook in the file 'features_info.txt' and 'features.txt' files of the original data source**
